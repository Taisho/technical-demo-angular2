# Technical Demo (User Interface for a Trading Bot)

![Screen Cast](/README/screen-recording.gif?raw=true "Screen Cast")

This is a GUI for a trading bot in a very early stage. Many features are not yet or poorly implemented (like not displaying volume data at the moment).

## Key features:
  * Price labels on right side of viewport are displayed nicely
  * dragging the mouse over either the price or the volume viewports scrolls their contents
  * Price and Volume viewports are resizeable (relatively to one another)
  
## Missing/Poorly implemnted features
  * Price candles and time periods get misaligned frequiently while scrolling (while at times get aligned almost perfectly)
  * No trading volume data is being displayed
  * The mechanics of displaying time labels needs complete rethinking

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4201/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
